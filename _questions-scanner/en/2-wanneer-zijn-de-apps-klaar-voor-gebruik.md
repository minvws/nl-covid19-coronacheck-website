CoronaCheck and the CoronaCheck Scanner are currently being tested in field trials. These trials prove if the apps are working properly and show how they can be improved.

The apps will only be taken into use when their use has been approved by law. This legislation is necessary as a test declaration indirectly requires a visitor to be tested. When the apps are ready to be taken into use depends on when this legislation is implemented.
