The Dutch government wants to open social, cultural and sports locations in a responsible manner in times of corona. The CoronaCheck app allows visitors access to these locations, though only if a corona test shows they did not have corona at the time of testing. 

With the CoronaCheck Scanner, the scanner checks the validity of the visitor’s test declaration at the entrance.
