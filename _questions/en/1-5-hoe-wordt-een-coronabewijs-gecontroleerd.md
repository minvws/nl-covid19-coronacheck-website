Before you enter a location or activity in the Netherlands, an inspector uses the [CoronaCheck Scanner](/en/scanner) to check the validity of your certificate. They do so by scanning the QR code at the entrance.

The travel organisation, tour operator or country you're visiting will check the coronavirus pass at the border.
