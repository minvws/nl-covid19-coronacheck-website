In the CoronaCheck app, you get a different QR code for each vaccination you’ve had. Did you get a new vaccination or booster? Then CoronaCheck sometimes hides the QR codes of previous vaccinations, because you probably don’t need to show those anymore.

Which QR code you have to show depends on the requirements of the country you’re visiting. Check the travel advice on {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }}. In most cases, you have to show the QR code of your most recent vaccination.

You can still show and use hidden QR codes if needed.
