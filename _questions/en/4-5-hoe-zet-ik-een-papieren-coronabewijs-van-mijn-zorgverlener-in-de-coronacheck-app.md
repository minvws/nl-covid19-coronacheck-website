A certificate with QR code that you have received from your healthcare provider can be added in the CoronaCheck app. Even if you got it abroad. This way you can also use the certificate on your phone. It works like this:

1. Open the CoronaCheck app
2. Go to the menu
3. Choose ‘Scan to add certificate’ and follow the steps in the app

Do you have the CoronaCheck app on multiple phones? Repeat the steps for each device.
Do you like to make a printout of your certificates yourself? This will soon be possible on the CoronaCheck website.
