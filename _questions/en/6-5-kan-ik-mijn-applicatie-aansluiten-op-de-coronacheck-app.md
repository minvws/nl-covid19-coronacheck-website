Yes, you can. That way, your visitors can go from the CoronaCheck app to your (ticketing)application and return, all with one click. This connection is also possible for the CoronaCheck Scanner app. It allows the person scanning tickets to switch between the CoronaCheck scanner and your (ticketing)application, again with one click.

For more information about connecting, please check {{ site.data.links.aansluiting-apps[page.lang] }}.
