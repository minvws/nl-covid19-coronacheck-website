## Vaccinated or tested at GGD

If you don't have a citizen service number (BSN), you can still retrieve your corona certificate in the CoronaCheck app or on [coronacheck.nl](https://coronacheck.nl/en/). This is possible if you:

- have been vaccinated by the GGD; or
- have tested positive for COVID by the GGD.

Follow the steps in the app or on the website to retrieve your certificate without a BSN. You will need your date of birth and patient number for this. You can find your patient number in the appointment confirmation you have received from the GGD. 

## Vaccinated at a general practitioner or other health provider

Did you get your vaccination at a healthcare institution or your general practitioner? Ask your health provider to print a vaccination certificate for you.
