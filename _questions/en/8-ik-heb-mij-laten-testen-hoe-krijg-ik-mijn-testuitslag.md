If you’ve been tested for a field trial, you will receive your test results via email.
The email will also include a code. This code can be used to download your test results to the CoronaCheck app or at [www.coronacheck.nl/print](/print) where you can generate a QR code. The QR code serves as your test declaration. 

For more questions about testing for the pilot events, go to [www.testenvoortoegang.nl](http://www.testenvoortoegang.nl).
