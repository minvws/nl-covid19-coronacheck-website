Also without DigiD, you can get a coronavirus pass. How you obtain this depends on where you were vaccinated or tested. Find more information on {{ site.data.links.coronabewijs-hulp[page.lang] }}.

You'll receive your certificate printed or as a PDF file. [Read here how to add this certificate to the app](/en/faq/4-5-hoe-zet-ik-een-papieren-coronabewijs-van-mijn-zorgverlener-in-de-coronacheck-app/).
