Were you vaccinated abroad and have you received a certificate with QR code? Then you can add it to your CoronaCheck app.

Do you want to add your certificate with QR code to the app? Go to [I’ve received a certificate with QR code from my healthcare provider. How do I get this in the CoronaCheck app?](/en/faq/4-5-hoe-zet-ik-een-papieren-coronabewijs-van-mijn-zorgverlener-in-de-coronacheck-app/) to read how to add your QR code to the CoronaCheck app.

Didn’t receive a certificate with QR code? Check {{ site.data.links.buitenlandvaccinatie[page.lang] }}. You’ll find the latest information there.
