Starting Tuesday May 24, positive antigen test results can also be used to create an international recovery certificate. 

If you have tested positive with an antigen test in the past 180 days and have previously retrieved this test result in the CoronaCheck app, your certificate will automatically appear in the app within 14 days. Do you need your certificate earlier? Or have you not yet retrieved your test result in the CoronaCheck-app? Then add your positive test yourself by logging in with DigiD.
