**Please note** You can print your corona certificate up to and including 30 June 2023. Then the European legislation for corona certificates will expire. So print your certificates as soon as possible but before 1 July via [coronacheck.nl/print](/en/print).

After that time you can no longer print recovery certificates and vaccination certificates. Do you want to view your COVID-19 vaccination data after 30 June? Then you can request this from the agency that vaccinated you. Recovery receipts will not be available after this date.
