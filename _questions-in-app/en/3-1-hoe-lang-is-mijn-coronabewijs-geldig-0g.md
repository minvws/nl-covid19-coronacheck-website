The coronavirus entry pass is currently not in use within the Netherlands. 

For international travel, showing a corona virus entry pass is required in some countries. The following validities apply:

- A recovery certificate becomes valid 11 days after the positive test, until 180 days after the positive test.
- A vaccination certificate will be handed out after one vaccination. A full vaccination certificate in general is valid for 270 days. Please note: the QR codes of all your vaccinations always remain visible in the CoronaCheck-app, even after the 270 days. This is done because it varies by country how long a vaccination is valid and of which vaccination you have to show the QR code.  
Once you’ve received a new (booster)vaccination, you can add it yourself by logging in again with DigiD. A decision about the validity of booster vaccinations has not been made yet. For children up to 18 years old, a full vaccination certificate is valid indefinitely. This does not require a booster vaccination.
- The validity of test certificates differ per country.

**Please note:** Rules and regulations differ per country. Check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} before you leave to see what certificate you need and if your international certificate is valid at your destination.
