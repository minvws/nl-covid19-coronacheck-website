If you’ve added a foreign certificate to the CoronaCheck app by scanning, then it is possible that this QR code is no longer valid after some time. This is because the country that issued the QR code has determined the validity. For instance, QR codes on paper are valid for a maximum of 1 year in many countries. That QR code’s vaccination might still be valid, but the QR itself code is no longer. In that case, you can request a new QR code for that vaccination in the country you were vaccinated. Vaccinations of which the QR code is no longer valid will still count in the dose numbering of your vaccinations in the CoronaCheck app.
