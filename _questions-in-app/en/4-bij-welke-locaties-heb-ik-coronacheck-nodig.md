At this point in time, the CoronaCheck app is being tested in field trials. In the future, access to certain social, cultural and sports locations will require a negative test result: a visit to the museum, festival or football match.

The government will determine which locations will require a test declaration, but only after this has been approved by law. Moreover, the test declaration is only a temporary measure enabling short-term access to certain activities in a responsible manner.
