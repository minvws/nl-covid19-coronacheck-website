Vaccination certificates and recovery certificates are currently not in use within the Netherlands. At locations where a corona virus entry pass is required, visitors only get access with a test certificate (1G access).

A Dutch test certificate is valid until 24 hours after the moment of testing. Within these 24 hours, you’re able to visit multiple locations or activities with your certificate (the QR code). Please note: a test done by the GGD often isn’t available in CoronaCheck within 24 hours.

For international travel, showing a corona virus entry pass is required in some countries. The following validities apply:

- A recovery certificate becomes valid 11 days after the positive test, until 180 days after the positive test.
- A vaccination certificate will be handed out after one vaccination. A full vaccination certificate in general is valid for 270 days. Please note: the QR codes of all your vaccinations always remain visible in the CoronaCheck-app, even after the 270 days. This is done because it varies by country how long a vaccination is valid and of which vaccination you have to show the QR code.  
Once you’ve received a new (booster)vaccination, you can add it yourself by logging in again with DigiD. A decision about the validity of booster vaccinations has not been made yet. For children up to 18 years old, a full vaccination certificate is valid indefinitely. This does not require a booster vaccination.
- The validity of test certificates differ per country.

**Please note:** Rules and regulations differ per country. Check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} before you leave to see what certificate you need and if your international certificate is valid at your destination.
