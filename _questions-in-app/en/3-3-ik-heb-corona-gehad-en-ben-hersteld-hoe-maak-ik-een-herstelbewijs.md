At this moment, it’s not possible to create a Dutch recovery certificate, because recovery certificates are currently not in use within the Netherlands.

You can create an international recovery certificate. A number of rules apply:

- The recovery certificate is valid from 11 days after the positive test result, but the recovery certificate may be created earlier.
- In the case of a recovery certificate, the positive test result may be a maximum of 180 days old.

For all rules regarding creating a recovery certificate, please look at the page {{ site.data.links.herstelbewijs[page.lang] }}.
