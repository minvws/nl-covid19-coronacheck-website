Did you recover from coronavirus before your first vaccination, or are you vaccinated with the Jansen vaccine? Then you may have received a vaccination certificate with a dose 2/1 or 3/1. The first number of the dose indicates the number of vaccinations you’ve had. The second number indicates how many vaccinations you need to be considered fully vaccinated.

Because you have recovered from coronavirus before your first vaccination or you are vaccinated with Jansen, you only need one vaccination to be fully vaccinated. Your first vaccination was therefore registered as dose 1/1. With every vaccination after this, only the first number of the dose changes. So, your second vaccination is registered as dose 2/1, your third vaccination as dose 3/1, etcetera.

Different rules apply to children up to 12 years old. Check {{ site.data.links.eisen-en-geldigheid[page.lang] }}.
