The government is working hard to open public venues in a responsible manner. Access testing plays a key role and allows opening of social, cultural and sports locations faster yet responsibly. 

The CoronaCheck app allows people access to these locations, but only if a corona test proves they did not have corona at the time of testing. In the app, the valid negative test result generates a test declaration by means of a QR code.

The government is also working on the CoronaCheck Scanner. This app is used by the scanner to check the validity of the visitor’s test declaration before allowing access to the premises.
