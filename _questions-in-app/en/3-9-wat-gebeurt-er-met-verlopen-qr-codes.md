How long QR codes remain in the CoronaCheck app depends on whether the QR code is of a vaccination, recovery or test certificate.

- You get a separate QR code in the CoronaCheck app for each vaccination you’ve had. Because it varies by country how long a vaccination is valid and of which vaccination you have to show the QR code, the QR codes of all your vaccinations always remain visible in the app. On {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} you can see how many vaccinations you need to have in the country you are visiting.
- The QR code of a test certificate remains in the app for up to 28 days after you’ve added it. After that, the QR code disappears from the CoronaCheck app. On {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} you can find how long a test certificate is valid in the country you are visiting.
- The QR code of a recovery certificate remains in the app until 180 days after the positive test. After that, the QR code disappears from the CoronaCheck app.

Please note that your certificate still being visible in the CoronaCheck app doesn’t mean it’s valid in all countries. The rules can vary from country to country. So check {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }} before your departure to see if and how long your international coronavirus pass is valid at your destination.
