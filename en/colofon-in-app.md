The CoronaCheck and CoronaCheck Scanner apps have been developed by the Ministry of Public Health, Welfare and Sport in collaboration with the RIVM and the national GGD institutions. The app could not have been realised without the help of dozens of experts, experience experts and a large civilian open-source community, who has monitored the process and tested the app as it was being developed.

## Source code

The app’s source code and its backend systems are all publicly available. You can find all code on [GitHub](https://github.com/minvws). This way, the precise way the app works is verifiable and controllable by many people, who can also help discover any potential vulnerabilities.

## Contributions

The development of CoronaCheck, the issuance of coronavirus passes for travel, and the connection to the European gateway have been made possible thanks to a financial contribution from the European Commission.
