## The QR code of my vaccination has expired. <br />What should I do?

Your QR code can expire if you’ve added it yourself to the CoronaCheck app. For example if you’ve scanned a QR code of a paper certificate, or from a foreign coronavirus app. Your vaccination is still valid, but the certificate you’ve added isn't.

Because your vaccination is included in your vaccination series, the QR code remains in the app, but you can no longer use this QR code.


## My QR code is hidden. What does this mean?

In the CoronaCheck app, you get a different QR code for each vaccination you’ve had. You might not see all vaccinations in the overview. CoronaCheck sometimes hides the QR codes of previous vaccinations, because you probably don’t need to show those anymore.

Which QR code you have to show depends on the requirements of the country you’re visiting. Check the travel advice on {{ site.data.links.wijsopreis[page.lang] }}. In most cases, you have to show the QR code of your most recent vaccination.

You can still show and use hidden QR codes if needed.


##  What does a dose 2/1 or 3/1 on my vaccination certificate mean?

Did you recover from coronavirus before your first vaccination, or are you vaccinated with the Jansen vaccine? Then you may have received a vaccination certificate with a dose 2/1 or 3/1. The first number of the dose indicates the number of vaccinations you’ve had. The second number indicates how many vaccinations you need to be considered fully vaccinated.

Because you have recovered from coronavirus before your first vaccination or you are vaccinated with Jansen, you only need one vaccination to be fully vaccinated. Your first vaccination was therefore registered as dose 1/1. With every vaccination after this, only the first number of the dose changes. So, your second vaccination is registered as dose 2/1, your third vaccination as dose 3/1, etcetera.

Different rules apply to children up to 12 years old. Check {{ site.data.links.eisen-en-geldigheid[page.lang] }}.
